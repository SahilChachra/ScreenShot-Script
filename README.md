<H1>ScreenShot Script</H1>
<h3 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    This script is used to take screenshot after every given interval of time. 
    It can be stopped by pressing a key combination. 
    This can be used to make a timelapse while you code something by taking repeated screenshot and then playing it as a video by editing it in Video editing software. 
    Also, we can take single shot as in normal screenshots and save it directly in given location</h2>
